# Lecture-project
This project is a Smart City Management System that uses Event-Driven Programming (EDP) to model interactions between different city subsystems. The system is designed to showcase how components such as traffic, emergency response, and environmental monitoring can work together efficiently.

Features

Key Components:

Traffic Manager

Monitors traffic levels and alerts when congestion is detected.

Adjusts traffic flow during emergencies.

Emergency Manager

Detects emergencies (e.g., accidents or fires) and informs relevant subsystems.

Optimizes response routes.

Environment Manager

Monitors air quality and alerts citizens if levels are unsafe.

Optimizes waste collection schedules based on sensor data.

Citizen Interaction

Sends alerts about traffic, air quality, and emergencies to city residents.

Provides recommendations to improve daily life in the city.

Event-Driven Design:

The system uses a centralized EventBus for communication between components. Each subsystem can emit and respond to events, ensuring modularity and flexibility.

AI Integration:

AI can be integrated for predictive analytics, such as forecasting traffic patterns and identifying potential environmental risks.

User Interface (Optional):

An interactive dashboard can be added to provide real-time updates and allow citizens to report issues or receive alerts.
